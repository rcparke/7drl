# 7drl


progress through the http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

currently part 3

keep updated in github for practice in rcparke/7drl then adjust the engine to suit my goals


## activating venv through powershell:

cd\

7drl\scripts\activate.ps1

cd 7drl

python main.py

start editing with visual studio code


## potential future changes:

change line of sight

adjust map generation

implement spell system (much easier said than done)

- card/deck/draw based inspired by noita
- probably dont have wrapping
